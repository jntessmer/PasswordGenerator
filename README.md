Homework3 Random Password

The pupose of this password generator is to help people create very secure passwords. Secure passwords are useful in detering people from being able to gain access to your information. Using an application to create a password takes away the worry of creating a strong enough password as well as saves time in creating different ones everytime. 

The way this application is suppose to work is by entering a number into the length of the password then selecting the characters that will be used in the password. I wasnt able to figure out what about my JavaScript code was broken.
